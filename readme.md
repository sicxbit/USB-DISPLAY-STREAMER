# USB-DISPLAY-STREAMER
so yeah i am tryna build a usb to display streamer which can mirror my pc screen into my phone

## Application

so in order to do video editing i needed to colorgrade a project but the thing is i cant just color correct on my pc and get a different output on my phone ( the difference between LCD and oled is too high on my devices), Yes i have searched for other applications which can do this and all of them are incredibly pricey which i can't afford 
so yeah i will do this myself 

## Goal #1
Stream my pc screen to my phone via USB
