# USB Display Streamer

A lightweight project to mirror your PC screen to your phone via **USB**, built for creators and tinkerers who want control ‚Äî without the high price tag.

##  Purpose

While editing videos, I ran into a big issue ‚Äî color grading on my LCD monitor looked totally different on my phone's OLED screen. I needed an affordable way to **preview and color grade directly for my phone display**.

Most apps out there are either:
- **Too expensive**, or  
- **Not tailored** to my workflow

So I built my own.

## Project Milestones
